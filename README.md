A Nintendo DS emulator developed for fun, with performance and multicore CPUs in mind.
A from scratch rewrite of my previous emulator aiming to try new techniques and achieve higher code quality.


**This is highly experimental software.**
I am developing this emulator for fun and learning only.
I do **not** intend to replace any of the established DS emulators.  
**If you are looking for a mature emulator, [melonDS](https://github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS) is the way to go.**
